# CPS710 ‚Äì Compilers and Interpreters

This repository outlines key learnings and project experience from **CPS 710: Compilers and Interpreters** at Toronto Metropolitan University.

## üìò Course Overview

Introduces core principles of compiler design, covering formal language theory, lexical scanning, parsing, semantic analysis, intermediate code, and target code generation. Students apply engineering practices to build a working compiler or interpreter. The course also includes symbol tables, optimization techniques, and the role of assemblers and preprocessors in modern language processing systems.

## üß™ Learning Components

Throughout the term, students complete a series of labs and assignments focused on:
- Lexical and syntactic analysis
- Finite state machines and parsing algorithms
- Abstract syntax tree construction
- Semantic analysis and symbol tables
- Intermediate and assembly-level code generation
- Compiler design using engineering methodologies

These activities reinforce theoretical concepts with practical, low-level implementation work.
